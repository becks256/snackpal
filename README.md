# snackpal

Snackpal helps busy parents build a quick daily snack and meal plan for their toddler aged children.  This tool ensures that a healthy balance of protien, fruits, vegetables, and grains are present in each daily meal plan, reducing the worry parents can have that they are preparing the right meals and snacks for their children. Snack pal does all of this behind the scenes and generates a full month's worth of plans and exports them as a csv.

The generated csv can quickly & easily be openend in a spreadsheet editing app and formatted to appear like a calendar.  In my own case, I print it and stick it on my fridge with a magnet.

To run the tool, simply have node installed, clone down this repository and from within the project directory, run the following command:

``` shell
node ./index.js
